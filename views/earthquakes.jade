h4 Earthquakes
p.
	An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the perceptible shaking of the surface of the Earth, which can be violent enough 
	to destroy major buildings and kill thousands of people. The severity of the shaking can range from barely felt to violent enough to toss people 
	around. Earthquakes have destroyed whole cities. They result from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. 
	The seismicity, seismism or seismic activity of an area refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time.

		Earthquakes are measured using observations from seismometers. The moment magnitude is the most common scale on which earthquakes larger than 
		approximately 5 are reported for the entire globe. The more numerous earthquakes smaller than magnitude 5 reported by national seismological 
		observatories are measured mostly on the local magnitude scale, also referred to as the Richter magnitude scale. These two scales are numerically 
		similar over their range of validity. Magnitude 3 or lower earthquakes are mostly almost imperceptible or weak and magnitude 7 and over potentially 
		cause serious damage over larger areas, depending on their depth. The largest earthquakes in historic times have been of magnitude slightly over 9, 
		although there is no limit to the possible magnitude. The most recent large earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or larger was a 9.0 magnitude earthquake in 
		Japan in 2011 (as of March 2014), and it was the largest Japanese earthquake since records began. Intensity of shaking is measured on the modified 
		Mercalli scale. The shallower an earthquake, the more damage to structures it causes, all else being equal.

		At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and sometimes displacement of the ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake 
		is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides, and occasionally volcanic activity.
		In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event — whether natural or caused by humans — that generates seismic waves. 
		Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults, but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests. 
		An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.

		Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere in the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. 
		The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase 
		the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued 
		relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until 
		the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. 
		This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing 
		an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound 
		theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to 
		power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy 
		and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.
